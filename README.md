# Professional-README-Generator
This application reflects the utilization of node.js and the inquirier NPM. 

I downloaded the Inquirier NPM which I was able to utilize in my integrated terminal within VSCode. From there, I added the sample questions for the user within the terminal. Upon completion and when inputting "node index" in the terminal, the user will be presented with sample questions that were created.
